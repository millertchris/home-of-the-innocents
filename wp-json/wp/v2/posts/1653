After dropping some envelopes into the mailbox outside of Walgreen\u2019s, I turned around and met the full force of a powerful yet simple piece of advertising: the face of a child next to the words \u201cProtecting kids from the people they love.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Though I\u2019ve always admired their work, I had never realized that Home of the Innocents was an emergency shelter. For the first time in months, I didn\u2019t think about politics, my job, or myself. I felt ashamed that I had forgotten some of the most vulnerable members of my community, that I had just been standing on the sidewalk grumbling about paying bills and being cold as I walked back to my safe, warm home filled with all of the things I need, plus many more items that I could live without. I had a fridge full of food. A nice car with a full tank of gas. I wasn\u2019t worried that someone I deeply feared but loved would be inside my house waiting to take his or her anger out on me, nor was I wondering if I would be able to eat again soon or if I\u2019d get to sleep in a bed or use a toothbrush that night. I felt grateful in a profound way, and I knew that I needed to act.<\/p>\n<p>Before I began walking home, I pulled out my phone to take a photo of the billboard and posted it on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1654\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/15977776_10209456110543987_1670410211742068421_n.jpg?resize=436%2C280\" alt=\"15977776_10209456110543987_1670410211742068421_n\" width=\"436\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/15977776_10209456110543987_1670410211742068421_n.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/15977776_10209456110543987_1670410211742068421_n.jpg?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/15977776_10209456110543987_1670410211742068421_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I asked my friends and customers if they would be up for a supply drive or fundraiser party at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fondoflouisville.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fond<\/a>, my restaurant &amp; tiny grocery store. The response was pretty remarkable, so the next morning, I announced a supply drive with the goal of collecting at least one of every item on the Home&#8217;s Winter Wish List in\u00a0five days. Each donation brought to Fond would be traded for a small gift certificate, and each donor would be entered to win a massage from Missy at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sensationssalonandspa.com\/services\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sensations Salon &amp; Spa<\/a>. Because the deadline was so soon, I wanted to make sure there would be plenty of motivation for folks to get involved quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We managed to put together all but five\u00a0items on the list in five days. Most people brought their donations directly to Fond. Others sent me money via PayPal that I shopped with, which is something I\u2019m always willing to do for a worthy cause. There were some items that I assumed would be nearly impossible to casually collect, like furniture and toddler beds, but one couple surfed Amazon and donated\u00a0two\u00a0new beds with sheets, blankets, AND pillows! Immediately after the deadline, two more donors provided most of the items we still needed, so we just barely missed the goal. I am very proud of how much we were able to achieve in one week, and I hope that our drive will inspire others to take up collections of their own.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1655\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"img_9773\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9773.jpg?w=1800 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1656\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"img_9774\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9774.jpg?w=1800 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1657\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"img_9805\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/IMG_9805.jpg?w=1800 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Especially in times of political and social unrest, it\u2019s easy to assume that people don\u2019t care about each other because they\u2019re not actively or visibly lending hands to affect change, but just staying alive tends to be overwhelming, expensive, and distracting for most of us. When you\u2019re able to focus long enough to select a worthy cause for your spare time or your extra money, it\u2019s difficult to know where your contribution will make an impact. I know firsthand that Home of the Innocents is a place where every donation counts and will literally change lives. It\u2019s an organization that allows you to rest easy on your pillows at night knowing that you\u2019ve helped provide both pillows AND safety for people in need of these very basic human essentials.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are far too many choices in this world when it comes to deciding when and where to donate our excess resources, so we\u2019re all more likely to be generous when we have a specific cause to focus on. I\u2019m happy to be a person shining a flashlight into the dark areas one by one, smiling, and saying, \u201cCome on &#8211; let\u2019s do this!\u201d The more attention I can divert towards attainable goals that will help people in need, the better the world will be.
