She has worked with children with hearing loss for more than 35 years. She has worked as an itinerant teacher and preschool\/kindergarten teacher in public schools. She has also been a preschool teacher, listening and spoken language therapist, and early intervention therapist in private schools in five states. She taught Deaf Education at both undergraduate and graduate levels, focusing on speech development. Currently, she works as an Early Interventionist with First Steps, and also sees school aged children for language and academic work. She is available for consulting with regular classroom teachers who have a child with hearing loss in their classroom.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of work, Mary enjoys travelling, reading, and spending time with her granddaughter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mary Beth Dean, M.S.
