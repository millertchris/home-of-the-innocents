He was eleven yearsold when he visited his first juke joint in Clarksdale, MS called Smitty&#8217;s Red Top. It was there that he met blues musicians\u00a0James &#8220;Super Chicken&#8221; Johnson, &#8220;The Oil Man&#8221; Big Jack Johnson, Mr. Johnnie Billington, and others. He became friends\u00a0with them, and by age thirteen he was sitting in with many of these bluesmen. Under the tutelage of Wesley &#8220;Mississippi \u00a0June Bug&#8221; Jefferson, Adam became an official member of the Wesley Jefferson Southern Soul Band until the untimely death of his mentor in 2009. Adam continues to prefect his skills as a bluesman by playing the clubs in and around the Louisville area, sometimes traveling to Mississippi or Chicago to perform. Not looking for fame or fortune, but feeling blessed he has the opportunity to \u201cplay the blues for you.&#8221; His band includes long time bass player James Warfield, who has sixty-plus years experience, Lenny Popp on drums and occasionally Brick Marlin on harmonica.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10:30 &#8211; 12:00 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Walnut-Street-Rythmn-and-Blues-Band-175085142546713\/\">Walnut Street Blues Band<\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nStarted by KBS founding member Foree Wells in 1989 with his sons Greg and Michael, the Walnut Street Blues Band has played gigs from Chicago to Atlanta and represented the blues society at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis. \u00a0Their CD &#8220;It&#8217;s a New Day, Brother&#8221; is available at the Kentuckiana Blues Society booth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Festival Sponsors<\/strong><br \/>\nDistrict 10 Metro Councilman Pat Mulvihill<br \/>\nBud Light<br \/>\nCheck&#8217;s Cafe<br \/>\nInfo+<br \/>\nGermantown Chiropractic<br \/>\nShuffitt Automotive Napa AutoCare Center<br \/>\nWFPK<br \/>\nDC Productions<br \/>\nKentuckiana Blues Society<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the Germantown Schnitzelburg Blues Festival, please contact KBS board member Gary Sampson at 502.724.9971 or by email at <a href=\"mailto:gary@kbsblues.org\">gary@kbsblues.org<\/a>.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1327500504005869\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1327500504005869\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Friday and Saturday, June 2 and 3, the Kentuckiana Blues Society (KBS) and Check&#8217;s Cafe will host the eighth annual Germantown Schnitzelburg Blues Festival at the corner of Hickory Street and Burnett Ave. In addition to our sponsors, we receive support from District 10 Metro Councilman Pat Mulvihill.
