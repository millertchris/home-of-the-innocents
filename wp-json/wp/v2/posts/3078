Since fall of 2017, she has been a DJ for the Home\u2019s holiday celebrations, residential parties, and various other events. She was chosen for the award based on her dedication to introducing the children to a variety of music, while also playing songs they love. She has figured out many of their favorite songs and plays them before they have the chance to ask!<\/p>\n<p>What Jessica enjoys most about volunteering is the bond she shares with the children over music. A few of them have expressed their desires to DJ, so Jessica takes the opportunity to show them they can do it if they\u2019re dedicated, no matter what\u2019s happened in their past. In Jessica\u2019s words, \u201cmy goal is to inspire, and I love that I get to do that often at the Home.\u201d We appreciate her bringing joy to the children and showing them they can accomplish their dreams and goals!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in volunteering for the Home, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/help-the-home\/volunteer\/\">Volunteer page<\/a> to begin the application process or for more information.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volunteer of the Month is awarded to someone who goes above and beyond in their role at the Home, exemplifying the values of Home of the Innocents in all the work they do and time they give to the children and families we serve.
