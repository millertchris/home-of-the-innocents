Once they moved into foster care, their situation only became worse due to multiple abusive foster parents.\u00a0During that time, Alice stepped into the role of parenting Carrie by washing, dressing, disciplining, and cooking for her. As they became preteens, Carrie\u2019s father chose to step up to his responsibility as a parent and got his children out of foster care. Carrie expressed that her parenting models ranged from the \u201cparentified\u201d behaviors of a slightly older sibling, abusive or indifferent styles of three foster parents, to sometimes overly strict or overly lax style of her father.<\/p>\n<p>Carrie was eager to figure out which of the varying parenting styles she observed was the healthiest. She realized that Alice, having taken on significant parenting responsibilities as a young girl, had been robbed her of childhood experiences. Pregnant with her second child, Carrie now understood that it\u2019s her responsibility to be in the parenting role and not to place that obligation on her kids.\u00a0She identified that the harsh parenting attitudes she experienced in foster care should be replaced with nurturing attitudes that build children\u2019s confidence. She also reconciled that her father\u2019s inconsistent parenting likely stemmed from his lack of understanding his daughters\u2019 needs.<\/p>\n<p>As her PASS classes came to an end, Carrie expressed her gratitude for the program and wished her mother, father, and foster parents had taken the classes before becoming parents.\u00a0She shared that the program gave her a new perspective on being a mother and now she plans to make healthier choices for her family!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of Carrie\u2019s growth and for all the parents striving to make a difference for their children.
