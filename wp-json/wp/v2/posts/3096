Please consider being one of our holiday elves to provide Christmas to one or more of the 700 kid\u2019s that receive services at the Home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Collect items<\/strong> from our Aftercare Holiday wish list and help a homeless young adult in our community. Items include: adult size coats, bed-in-a-bag, lamps, gloves, hats, scarves, and gift cards to Kroger, Target, or Walmart.<\/p>\n<p>Our Aftercare program provides services to young adults (ages 18-24) and their children. Our experienced and dedicated staff help Aftercare clients develop independent living skills, enroll in and complete education, access community resources, seek affordable housing, and access mental health services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate items<\/strong> our kids can use in their rooms at the Home to make them feel comfy and cozy as they transition into residential services. Our children\u2019s needs are often more practical than simply love and compassion. The Home relies on the generosity of our community to help us provide for the hundreds of children we serve on a daily basis. Items include: plastic storage containers, laundry baskets, MP3 Player, headphones, small rug, fuzzy blankets, and more.<\/p>\n<p>To get matched with a child\u2019s wish list or to receive information about our holiday collection drives, contact April Sage at <a href=\"mailto:Asage@homeoftheinnocents.org\">Asage@homeoftheinnocents.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your support through the holiday season and beyond!
