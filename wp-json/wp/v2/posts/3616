He is our longest standing volunteer, uplifting residents in our Kosair Charities Pediatric Convalescent Center since 1989. When Jim first started volunteering he became disheartened because of the lack of response kids gave him, until one nurse told him, \u201cSome of them might not be able to speak, but they recognize you and express their happiness in different ways.\u201d That moment inspired him to continue volunteering, and now 29 years later he is in tune with the special ways each kid he works with communicates.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years at the Home, Jim has gone on outings, participated in countless activities, worked as a certified lifeguard, and most importantly, created meaningful bonds with the residents. He shares, \u201cSome people ask why I volunteer if I don\u2019t get paid. I tell them, \u2018I do get paid with smiles and laughter from the kids, and that\u2019s all I need.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We are so appreciative of Jim\u2019s longevity in spending time with our residents, he is a joy to not only them, but to our team members as well!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in volunteering for the Home, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/help-the-home\/volunteer\/\">Volunteer page<\/a> to begin the application process or for more information.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volunteer of the Month is awarded to someone who goes above and beyond in their role at the Home, exemplifying the values of Home of the Innocents in all the work they do and time they give to the children and families we serve.
