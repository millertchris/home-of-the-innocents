Her role has evolved over the past two years. She began entering data for non-monetary donations into our donor database. Now, she helps organize invitations, enters volunteer information, and prepares food for the Cornerstone Peer Support Group, part of our Aftercare Program. She is always willing to help with any work that is needed. Rose says that one of her largest accomplishments as a volunteer was finding and recording donor signage across the entire campus.<\/p>\n<p>Rose expressed that working for our organization is rewarding because of our mission to improve the lives of others. She feels like she\u2019s a part of the team. April Sage, Outreach Manager who works with Rose regularly, said, \u201cRose is always the highlight of my week! Not only is she super-efficient at the work that she does, she has also become a great friend. I treasure the time I get to spend with her.\u201d Rose has clearly impacted our employees and continues to do so with the help she provides.<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in volunteering for the Home, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/help-the-home\/volunteer\/\">Volunteer page<\/a> to begin the application process or for more information. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volunteer of the Month is awarded to someone who goes above and beyond in their role at the Home, exemplifying the values of Home of the Innocents in all the work they do and time they give to the children and families we serve.
