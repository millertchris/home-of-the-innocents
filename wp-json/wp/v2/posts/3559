Our Pathways HOME program, formerly known as Aftercare, provides services to homeless young adults between the ages of 18-24 and their children.<\/p>\n<p>Joe was nominated for doing beyond what is expected of him. When he was asked to help a homeless person in a wheelchair with no gloves, he quickly tracked the man down and provided him gloves and a link to services. During the coldest weather of this season, Joe and his team participated in Louisville\u2019s homeless count at 3:30 am in sub-zero temperatures. To help a family fulfill their dream of being in their own home for Christmas, Joe and his team spent Christmas Eve helping the family move into their home.<\/p>\n<p>In his position, Joe ensures Pathways HOME is in compliance with grant funders and fellow partner agencies. He consistently maintains relationships with other organizations and monitors program performance.<\/p>\n<p>What Joe enjoys most about his job is positively impacting people\u2019s lives. He has worked with the homeless population for 15 years, driven by providing safe and warm housing. He loves seeing clients use our organization\u2019s services to learn how to manage housing payments independently. Joe shared, \u201cI feel very supported and grateful to work at the Home and with the team members here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of the work Joe has accomplished helping young homeless adults in our community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each month, President and CEO Paul Robinson awards a team member who exemplifies our core values of excellence, compassion, wellness, and empowerment.
