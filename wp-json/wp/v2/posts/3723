Since 1999, he has been helping with outings, activities, social visits, and swim therapy for our residents with medically complex needs.<\/p>\n<p>One of his most memorable moments with the Home was when he assisted in taking residents to the Kentucky State Fair. Preparing the children, loading them on the buses, and wheeling them around the fairgrounds was straining work, however, he was determined to have an enjoyable day with them. Unexpectedly during their trip, the state fair staff delivered balloons, hugs, and words of encouragement to the children and volunteers. Bill, along with the children, were filled with an abundance of gratitude and happiness!<\/p>\n<p>To Bill, his time spent volunteering was much more than showing up and completing tasks assigned to him. \u201cI got so much more out of the experience than I gave,\u201d he shares. We are so appreciative of Bill and his dedication in spending quality time with our residents!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in volunteering for the Home, visit our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/help-the-home\/volunteer\/\">Volunteer page<\/a>\u00a0to begin the application process or for more information.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volunteer of the Month is awarded to someone who goes above and beyond in their role at the Home, exemplifying the values of Home of the Innocents in all the work they do and time they give to the children and families we serve.
