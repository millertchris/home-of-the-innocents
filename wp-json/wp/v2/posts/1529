Upon arrival, his temperature had risen to 108.7. We were once again given no hope of survival, and if he did survive, he would never be the same again. The high temperature was too much for anyone to overcome.<\/p>\n<p>In the Spring of 2014, our family was told there wasn\u2019t anything else that could be done for Jonah. We should take him home and enjoy what time we had left with him. With the high fever and the overall change in Jonah\u2019s condition, his care at home was simply too much for my daughter and her husband to handle, even with the help of some in-home health nurses. Through much heartache, my daughter and son-in-law\u00a0had to make one of the hardest decisions they\u2019ve ever had to make. They simply could not handle Jonah at home with all the care he required. This began the search for a place that Jonah could be sent to receive the treatments and care that he would need.<\/p>\n<p>The first place that was found was in the southeast\u00a0suburbs of Chicago. That meant a six hour drive from his home in Illinois for any of our family to visit him. The family started calling every hospital they could think of. When we spoke to Norton Children&#8217;s Hospital in Louisville they told us about Home of the Innocents. The rest, as they say, is history. We believe that God has had his hand in Jonah\u2019s life since day one. There is a waiting list to get a bed in KCPCC, but God flew open the doors and a bed was available in the time frame we needed.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1531\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Jonah-pic-a.jpg?resize=300%2C300\" alt=\"jonah-pic-a\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Jonah-pic-a.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Jonah-pic-a.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Jonah-pic-a.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Jonah-pic-a.jpg?w=811&amp;ssl=1 811w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Home of the Innocents has been such a huge blessing to our family. Jonah is alive and doing well, much better than anyone ever thought he would, even the doctors and nurses who work at the Home!\u00a0We hear stories about how scared everyone was to handle Jonah because of all the issues he\u2019s had. Now, I think sometimes they fight over who gets him. His smile is infectious! His demeanor is inspiring. He has the loudest silent laugh you will ever hear.<\/p>\n<p>This is only such a small portion of his journey.
