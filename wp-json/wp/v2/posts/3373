He joined the Open Arms team because of their dedication to offering pediatric care for a medically challenging population. He\u2019s aware his patients at Open Arms need a dedicated provider capable of helping them achieve health, development, and happiness. An important factor for Dr. Kinney is that he is exposed to many patient demographics. This has taught him to be a compassionate, culturally sensitive pediatrician.<\/p>\n<p>To Dr. Kinney, the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing his patients starting school, remembering when they were first visiting him as infants. He is happy to see them achieve their first benchmarks and feels gratitude for the role he played in preparing them for a life of wellness.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2014, Dr. Kinney has been a faculty member at the University of Louisville\u2019s Department of Pediatrics as well as the Medical Director at Open Arms Children\u2019s Health. After finishing Medical School at the University of Louisville, he completed residency training in Pediatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine and Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Dr. Kinney then worked in the pediatric emergency department for three years at the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, before returning to his calling of primary care pediatrics.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Kinney enjoys the challenges presented by working in pediatrics. He and his wife, also a pediatrician, have two beautiful daughters and one mischievous beagle. The love watching sports, hiking, cooking, and (of course) eating food together!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr. Matthew Kinney, MD, is the Medical Director at Open Arms Children\u2019s Health.
