She has positively impacted residents and team members for 25 years.<\/p>\n<p>Deborah was nominated because she ensures our children get the services they need for their overall health and well-being. She advocates for our residents, even when they don\u2019t think they have a voice. Most importantly, she helps them achieve their fullest potential.<\/p>\n<p>As a Residential Treatment Coordinator, Deborah arranges appointments, communicates with social workers, and ensures documentation is completed. However, she says the most important part of her job is the relationship she has with our residents. Recently, a former resident called Deborah stating, \u201cI just wanted to hear voice and your positive words.\u201d The guidance and support she provides is cherished.<\/p>\n<p>Deborah describes her job as difficult at times, but rewarding in the end. When reflecting on the past 25 years, she acknowledges her accomplishments happened because of teamwork. In her words, \u201cwe can\u2019t be effective unless we work together.\u201d She lives each day while keeping this in mind.<\/p>\n<p>We are thankful for the time Deborah has worked with us, and we appreciate the impact she has on our residents!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each month, President and CEO Paul Robinson awards a team member who exemplifies our core values of excellence, compassion, wellness, and empowerment.
