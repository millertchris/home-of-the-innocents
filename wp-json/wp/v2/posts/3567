Young men who are over 18 and have recommitted to the state are able to participate as a resident even after they turn 18. This therapeutic program teaches skills necessary for independent living.<\/p>\n<p>In this program, residents learn about health, budgeting, work benefits, manners, cultural diversity, and other various topics. Each week, residents enjoy a night together doing fun activities that provide them comradery, allowing them to express their questions and concerns about independent living more comfortably.<\/p>\n<p>This differs from our other residential programs because of the level of freedom offered. When the boys show maturity and respect, they are trusted with the ability to spend time in the community on their own. One resident shared, \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for this program. It has given me the opportunity to get a job and learn how to manage my time.\u201d This prepares them for a smooth transition out of residential housing.<\/p>\n<p>Samantha Prario, Program Manager, and Ra\u2019Shaun Logan, Residential Associate Director, are grateful to be involved with the program. They shared, \u201cWhen the residents leave their support system, they have to maintain their mental\/physical health.
