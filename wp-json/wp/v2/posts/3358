During graduate school, she completed fieldwork at Kosair Children\u2019s Hospital, Norton Suburban Hospital, and Frazier Rehab. Since graduating, Lauren has treated speech and language disorders, cognitive deficits, auditory processing disorders, swallowing and feeding difficulties, and social\/pragmatic skills. Throughout her career, she has gained extensive knowledge and experience working with clients with many diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, traumatic brain injuries, and developmental delays.<\/p>\n<p>Lauren is licensed in both Kentucky and Indiana and is a member of the American-Speech-Language-Hearing Association. She has experience supervising graduate students, as well as clinical fellows. Lauren volunteers for the Families for Effective Autism Treatment (FEAT) of Louisville and is a big sister in the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Kentuckiana program.
