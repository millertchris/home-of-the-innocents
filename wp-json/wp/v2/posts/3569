He joined the team because of his desire to work in a traditional physician environment. The majority of his clinical work is with the University of Louisville School of Medicine where he cares for patients alongside medical students, nursing students, pediatric residents, and faculty peers. The ability to serve patients independently at Open Arms, especially for refugee and high-risk adolescent populations, gives him a great sense of balance.<\/p>\n<p>To Dr. Patel, there are two main reasons he looks forward to work at Open Arms. First, he enjoys the collaborative nature of the organization. Team members and patients have access to many pediatric services all in one building, which is very efficient for cross-treatments. Secondly, he enjoys caring for patients from high-risk populations, in which the care has a tremendous positive impact on their immediate and future livelihood.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Patel is a Professor of Pediatrics in the division of general pediatrics at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. Dr. Patel is passionate about curricular and healthcare innovation using technology. For the past several years, he has focused his efforts in investigating and engaging in advocating for the use of social media in medical education and patient instruction.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of work, Dr. Patel enjoys taking photos of travels, environmental portraits, wildlife, landscapes, sports, concerts, and cityscapes. He has a talent for photography and is grateful when people follow his passion through his Instagram account, @U2photography.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr. Pradip Patel, MD, is a Pediatrician in our Open Arms Children\u2019s Health clinic, treating patients since 2013.
