She has been providing health care to our residents for five years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Brittany was nominated for the compassion she showed a resident and his family during his final moments with us. She brought his personal items to the hospital during his last days, spent countless hours by his side, and comforted him and his family during the difficult time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As a Registered Nurse, her main responsibilities include monitoring residents&#8217; conditions, administering medications, and providing primary care. Although, there are various other essential duties including suctioning, conducting treatments, and managing feeding tubes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Brittany enjoys her job and the team members she gets to work alongside each day. However, the most enjoyable part to her is seeing residents get the care they deserve. She knows the importance of their treatments and is joyful to see their positive wellbeing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are grateful for Brittany\u2019s attentiveness to our residents and proud to have her on our team!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Each month, President and CEO Paul Robinson awards a team member who exemplifies our core values of excellence, compassion, wellness, and empowerment.
