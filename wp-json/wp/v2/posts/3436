Our Aftercare program provides services to homeless young adults\u00a0and their children. One part of the program is a weekly peer support group meeting to learn necessary life skills. Lianne helps with this group, preparing meals for attendees and happily providing childcare as parents attend class! She is also quick to help clean after classes end.<\/p>\n<p>Lianne misses having small children of her own, so providing care for the children of Aftercare clients gives her a sense of fulfillment. Rocking them and hearing their sweet giggles makes her day! She knows how important this time is for their parents as they gain knowledge at class. She loves spending time with these families and is appreciative of the opportunity to work with them.<\/p>\n<p>Lianne\u2019s long term support for the Home is incredible. We appreciate her service and look forward to her continued friendship!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in volunteering for the Home, visit our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/help-the-home\/volunteer\/\">Volunteer page<\/a>\u00a0to begin the application process or for more information.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volunteer of the Month is awarded to someone who goes above and beyond in their role at the Home, exemplifying the values of Home of the Innocents in all the work they do and time they give to the children and families we serve.
