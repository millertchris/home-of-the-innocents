She works with elementary school-age children in their classrooms as a part of Little Ears\u2019 Community Outreach.<\/p>\n<p>Denley teaches <em>Dangerous Decibels<\/em> lessons with fourth graders and \u201c<em>How We Hear<\/em>\u201d with first graders. She has also taught other classes about hearing loss and how it affects their friends at school.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn <em>Dangerous Decibels<\/em>, we talk about why it is important to turn down the music and protect our hearing. The goal of this lesson is for the children to realize that we have to protect our hearing in order for us to have it and use it as we get older. The incidents of noise-induced hearing loss in children are on the rise because of children using earbuds and headphones to listen to their music and turning the sound up way too loud. With <em>Dangerous Decibels<\/em>, we are encouraging the kids to turn the sound down to preserve their hearing.\u201d Explains Denley. She is very passionate about what she teaches in the classrooms and hopes that the lessons she teaches will resonate with them for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201c<em>How We Hear<\/em>\u201d lessons she teaches are about how the hearing system works. She explains, \u201cthey learn how sound goes from the outer ear and ends up in the brain so that people can actually hear and understand what is being said or being heard.\u201d For this interactive lesson, she has children crawl through tunnels that represent the ear canal, bang a drum (ear drum), make a human chain (middle ear bones) and make hair cells out of bananas and pretzels (part of the hearing sensory organ). The activities she uses to teach the lessons really help the kids learn and retain the information.<\/p>\n<p>Little Ears began these hearing lessons when they learned there was a need for it. They were asked by schools to come teach kids about hearing and jumped at the opportunity to give back. Denley loves being able to make an impact on the kid\u2019s lives and enjoys seeing them achieve their highest potential. She can tell that the lessons she teaches have been a huge hit. Many of her classes send thank you cards and drawings of ears once classes have ended.<\/p>\n<p>If your child\u2019s class is interested in one of our hearing lessons, call Little Ears at Open Arms Children\u2019s Health at 502.596.1040.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sara Denley, Audiologist with Little Ears Hearing Center at Open Arms Children\u2019s Health, teaches lessons about hearing to children in local Louisville schools.
