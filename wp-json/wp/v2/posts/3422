As a child she was sent to Norton Children\u2019s Hospital for surgery, so she wanted to volunteer at an organization caring for children with similar experiences. This led her to the Home, specifically our Kosair Charities Pediatric Convalescent Center.<\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long for Tara to become friends with the kids. With each activity brought smiles, laughter, and joy. One of the kids, James, was eager to play games with Tara and would wait for her arrival every week!<\/p>\n<p>As Halloween approached, Tara spent countless hours helping team members plan a special party for the kids. Tara was unsure how it would go, \u201cI was nervous before the party, I wanted the kids to love it but didn\u2019t know what their reactions would be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To Tara\u2019s delight, they did love it! Some were running through the tunnel, while others were playing games together. Tara was relieved by their excitement, and proud of the work she put into creating the party.<\/p>\n<p>As 2018 came to an end, so did Tara\u2019s semester of volunteering. To her, this was much more than a school project. She learned about the fears, interests, and passions of the children she worked with. Tara enjoyed the experience so much, she plans to continue visiting the children for months to come!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-3423\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?resize=349%2C262\" alt=\"\" width=\"349\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2019\/01\/DSCN7572.jpg?w=1800 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re so grateful for Tara\u2019s dedication in creating a fun environment for our residents!
