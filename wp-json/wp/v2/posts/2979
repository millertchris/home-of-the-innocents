For the past year, he has visited two of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hosparushealth.org\/for-patients-and-families\/kourageous-kids.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kourageous Kids<\/a> residents every week. According to Ivy McCarty, KCPCC Activities Coordinator, he is a great role model and companion to these two young men. He is a also retired science teacher, so given his expertise, Ivy asked if he had interest in leading a one hour science program during the KCPCC weekly summer camp sessions. Ivy said he enthusiastically agreed, preparing and facilitating 11 weeks of programming. He adapted to each and every resident who attended, meeting their needs while building their confidence.<\/p>\n<p>Lynn Earl said every time his volunteer shifts are over he feels fulfilled because of the bond he shares with the children he serves. Whether it&#8217;s playing games, taking them to the backyard, or speaking positive words, he always tries to bring joy to them. We are so fortunate to have such an incredibly talented and giving volunteer and look forward to a continued relationship with him!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in volunteering for the Home, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/help-the-home\/volunteer\/\">Volunteer page<\/a> to begin the application process or for more information.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Volunteer of the Month is awarded to someone who goes above and beyond in their role at the Home, exemplifying the values of Home of the Innocents in all the work they do and time they give to the children and families we serve.
