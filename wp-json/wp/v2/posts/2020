When I first got here, I struggled with expressing myself and interacting with people. My first day here was a handful of a day. I realized for the first time in life, that acting a fool in life isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>The staff who come to work here every day really love us and their job. Being here I\u2019ve also learned it doesn\u2019t take blood to make a family. When you\u2019re down and out the people that work here are by your side and won\u2019t leave till you\u2019re up again.<\/p>\n<p>I used to think there was no hope, and that no one cared about all the things that I have been through, but being here I have people that truly do care. There are staff like Ms. Carmella, Ms. Ryann, Mrs. Amelda, Mr. Andrew, Weinberg staff, the Cafeteria Ladies, and all the House Supervisors and Program Managers who would drop everything in a second if you were in a crisis, or if you need help. You don\u2019t usually get those people in your life. Being here and with these people I\u2019ve decided I wanted to go to college and make something of myself.<\/p>\n<p>I no longer want to run and hide and bottle up my emotions. I want to be free and be mad and not be afraid. Home of the Innocents is a real life changer. This place is slowly helping me be able to let people in and love again. Before it was hard due to all the lies people told me and all the people leaving and giving up on me. But these people are different. They don\u2019t give up on you. They work with you to make it better.<\/p>\n<p>I admit, sometimes this place is a little much, but I know everyone is just trying to help you succeed, complete treatment and get out of here to live a normal life.<\/p>\n<p>I really thank this place a lot for everything they\u2019ve given me. They\u2019ve given me a home, food and a family. Just when I thought I was alone, I\u2019ve got a place full of people rooting for me to cross the finish line. I finally see something positive. Most of all, I finally see that I have a future ahead of me.<\/p>\n<p>I really want to thank Ms. Taylor. She is very inspirational. She challenged me somewhat. But she\u2019s really caring and she always there for you. I consider her, and most of the staff, a part of my family.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend this residential home to someone because it really helps and they will give you their best to help you. But, one thing I\u2019ve learned is you also got to work with them for this to work. Because, if not, then it\u2019s going to be a struggle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t give up, because Home of the Innocents will help you. You just got to open up. Don\u2019t be scared, it\u2019s all going to be okay.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently, children in our residential shelter had an essay contest.
