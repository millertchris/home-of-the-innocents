From the classroom, you often hear chants and roaring laughter followed by serene meditative music. One student, Emma*, shared, \u201cI like the games, but my favorite part of class is mindfulness. I\u2019m glad they helped me learn that I\u2019m more peaceful when I\u2019m aware of my feelings.\u201d Mindfulness is not only important when they act in a skit or small play, but is also applicable to their everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>In choir class, students are learning the elements of music and voice. Upon entering the classroom, their high energy is transformed into soothing harmonies. One student, Alex*, shared, \u201cI appreciate that I get to play piano and sing without being judged. I really enjoy it and I\u2019m glad I have someone to share it with.\u201d Nothing makes us happier than seeing our residents proudly engaging in their interests!<\/p>\n<p>Arts for Kosair Kids\u00ae in partnership with Fund for the Arts provides art experiences that our teenage girls and boys greatly benefit from.
