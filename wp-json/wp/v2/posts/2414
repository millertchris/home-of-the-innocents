Connor was back in our offices last week for a follow-up appointment, and we caught up with him and his mom, Hope, to see how he is doing! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are doing sign language at in his speech therapy sessions and he\u2019s babbling all the time. We have noticed he is starting to look when you say his name. He says &#8216;mama&#8217; very well! He will say &#8216;I&#8217; and &#8216;Hi.&#8217; We can turn on his favorite television shows; he will hear it and start dancing. It\u2019s just so awesome because he never did any of this before. This is the best decision we could have made for Connor and seeing the outcome of his progression in just in a few months is crazy to us. We are very fortunate we had this opportunity for Connor and can\u2019t thank everyone enough for all the help and support for us,\u201d shared Hope. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At his recent follow-up appointment with Dr. Shelley Moats, his hearing was tested in our sound booth. Dr. Moats said, \u201cHe is hearing deep sounds and will continue to make more progress with the help of Open Arms and his\u00a0Early Interventionist.\u201d Connor started meeting with his\u00a0Early Interventionist a week ago. Hope says, &#8220;She is stern and we really like her. She and Dr. Moats have really helped us in our journey with Connor&#8217;s implants so far.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We are thrilled to see the great progress Connor and other patients with Little Ears at Open Arms Children\u2019s Health are making!
