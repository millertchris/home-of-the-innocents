She also suffered from intrauterine growth restriction and the umbilical cord was 1\/3 the size it should have been.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor that delivered her told us if we\u00a0had not come to the hospital when we\u00a0did, she would not have made it.<\/p>\n<p>Even before birth, Alayna had already overcome many obstacles. At about two\u00a0months old, we\u00a0noticed her movements were different than what we remembered her big brother\u2019s to be at that age and began keeping a close eye on her development. At three months old, she was beginning to be delayed and at six\u00a0months old was placed in the First Steps program receiving physical therapy and occupational therapy.<\/p>\n<p>Her progress was very slow and she was not meeting milestones or goals that were set for her with physical\u00a0or occupational therapy. We\u00a0requested her doctors order an MRI of her brain as it was suggested that she may have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cerebralpalsy.org\/about-cerebral-palsy\/cause\/periventricular-leukomalacia\" target=\"_blank\">Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On December 20, 2013, we\u00a0received the phone call from the doctor confirming that Alayna did in fact have PVL and that it was severe (on both sides of her brain). A month after that, her neurologist diagnosed her with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cerebralpalsyguidance.com\/cerebral-palsy\/types\/spastic-quadriplegia\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spastic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy<\/a>, meaning all four\u00a0of her limbs are affected. Following these diagnoses, we continued with physical and occupational therapies, and added in speech therapy, until she turned 3.<\/p>\n<p>Upon aging out of First Steps, she began physical\u00a0and speech therapies at the Kids Center for Pediatric Therapies. Through the Kids Center, we learned of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/atc\/\" target=\"_blank\">the heated therapy pool at Home of the Innocents<\/a> by participating in a study hosted by Bellarmine University and Dr. Ennis. Once that study ended, we have continued to attend the pool with the Kids Center therapist.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1608 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/20170117_152515-e1489521726558-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300\" alt=\"20170117_152515\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/20170117_152515-e1489521726558.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/20170117_152515-e1489521726558.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/20170117_152515-e1489521726558.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.homeoftheinnocents.org\/app\/uploads\/2017\/03\/20170117_152515-e1489521726558.jpg?w=1200 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the pool, Alayna is free to move and stretch her muscles in a way that she is unable to outside of the water.
